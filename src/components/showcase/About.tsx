                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    From a young age, I've had a curiosity about how things
                    work. That curiosity naturally led me toward building
                    things, and eventually toward programming. This is
                    placeholder bio text — swap it out with your own story.

                <p>
                    I started programming more seriously in school, working on
                    a handful of passion projects along the way. Some of these
                    are viewable on my{' '}

                        <p>
                            Beyond software, I have a lot of hobbies that I
                            enjoy doing in my free time. The more tangible
                            hobbies I have are{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/music">Music Production</Link>{' '}
                            and creating{' '}
                            <Link to="/projects/art">Digital Art</Link>. You can
                            read more about each of these on their respective
                            pages under my projects tab. Some other hobbies I
                            enjoy are working out, cooking, and (unsurprisingly)
                            playing video games.
